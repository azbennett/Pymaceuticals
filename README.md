Week 5 assigment
Steve Bennett


Within the Jupyter Notebook named 'pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb' you will find the entire assigment and included analysis.

It also used the sub folder 'data' that contained the two CSV files (Mouse_metadata.csv + Study_results.csv) used to merge and analyize the data for the assignment.
